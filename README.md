# Queen’s Gambit Memory Game ♕
* Idea from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card).
* Cards displaying chess openings appear on the screen. Don’t pick the same one twice!
* [Live preview](https://www.meka.la/memory).
* I feature this project in my [portfolio](https://www.meka.la/).
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
